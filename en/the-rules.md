A great storm has shaken the aerial world, **scattering your herd and plantations** to the four corners of the sky!

Play as a brave **Pluvionaute** at the helm of your hot air balloon.
**Tow the flying islands**, **move the clouds**, and shape the sky to your advantage!

<img src="/assets/images/the-rules/fr/mise-en-place.svg" alt="Setup" style="max-width:436px;width:436px;position:relative;left:50%;margin-left:-218px;">

The game box is used as the game board.
Remove the **Hot Air Balloon Die**, the **6 Airship Tokens**, the **6 Missions**, and the **3 Player Aids** from the box.

The **10 Plain Islands**, **7 Forest Islands**, **5 Mountain Islands**, and **15 Clouds** are placed randomly (by shaking the box, for example) on the hexagonal slots in the box.
Each slot must either be occupied by an island or a cloud.

Each person takes an **Airship Token**.

The **Missions** used depend on the number of players:
* **2 and 3 players:** either ![Icon Square A](/assets/images/icons/square_a.svg) ![Icon Square B](/assets/images/icons/square_b.svg) ![Icon Square C](/assets/images/icons/square_c.svg), or ![Icon Circle A](/assets/images/icons/circle_a.svg) ![Icon Circle B](/assets/images/icons/circle_b.svg) ![Icon Circle C](/assets/images/icons/circle_c.svg)
* **4 players:** either ![Icon Square A](/assets/images/icons/square_a.svg) ![Icon Circle A](/assets/images/icons/circle_a.svg) ![Icon Square B](/assets/images/icons/square_b.svg) ![Icon Circle B](/assets/images/icons/circle_b.svg), or ![Icon Square A](/assets/images/icons/square_a.svg) ![Icon Circle A](/assets/images/icons/circle_a.svg) ![Icon Square C](/assets/images/icons/square_c.svg) ![Icon Circle C](/assets/images/icons/circle_c.svg), or ![Icon Square B](/assets/images/icons/square_b.svg) ![Icon Circle B](/assets/images/icons/circle_b.svg) ![Icon Square C](/assets/images/icons/square_c.svg) ![Icon Circle C](/assets/images/icons/circle_c.svg)
* **5 and 6 players:** all Missions

Randomly distribute one **Mission** per person, which they place face down in front of them.
**Their own Mission** can be consulted at any time during the game.

Designate the **first player randomly**, who takes the **Hot Air Balloon Die**.

![Example setup](/assets/images/the-rules/fr/mise-en-place-exemple.svg)
*Example setup for __4 players__. The __Missions__ and the __remaining Airship Tokens__ are set aside.*

<img src="/assets/images/the-rules/fr/but-du-jeu.svg" alt="Objective of the Game" style="max-width:402px;width:402px;position:relative;left:50%;margin-left:-201px;">

The objective of the game is to best accomplish your **Mission**, which has **TWO** goals:
* form the **largest plantation** of a certain type.
* form the **largest herd** of a certain type.

**Note:** A plantation (or a herd) consists of all the elements (or animals) in **a group of adjacent islands of the same type**.

<img src="/assets/images/the-rules/fr/mission-exemple.svg" alt="Mission example." style="max-width:222px;width:222px;position:relative;left:50%;margin-left:-111px;">

*Example of a Mission consisting of a __mushroom__ objective (plantation) and a __cow__ objective (herd).*

**Points earned** for each Mission goal are calculated based on the **state of the board at the end of the game**:
* one point for each element in **your largest plantation**.
* and one point for each animal in **your largest herd**.

![Example of point counting.](/assets/images/the-rules/counting-of-points.svg)
*Example of point counting for each objective at the end of the game. Only the largest plantation of each type counts. The same applies to herds of each type.*

**Note:** Players who share one of the two Mission goals **earn the **same** number of points for that goal.

<img src="/assets/images/the-rules/fr/tour-de-jeu.svg" alt="Gameplay" style="max-width:402px;width:402px;position:relative;left:50%;margin-left:-201px;">

The game consists of several rounds, with players taking turns **clockwise**.

During their turn, the player performs **the following actions in order**:

<img src="/assets/images/the-rules/fr/decollage.svg" alt="Takeoff" style="max-width:344px;width:344px;">

1. If your **Airship Token** is on the board, remove it from the board.
2. Roll the **Hot Air Balloon Die** onto the board aiming for an area where you want to land. Your hand should not hover over the board during this roll.
    - The spot where the die stops represents where your hot air balloon has landed after takeoff.
    - If the die ends up between multiple spaces, the active player chooses the space to land on from among them.
    - The number indicated by the die represents your **Movement Points** (see movement below).
3. If the die shows the **Airship** face, the player can choose any face of the **Hot Air Balloon Die** before moving (see movement below).

**Note:** Each player has **up to 2 attempts** to land the **Hot Air Balloon Die** on the board (this rule can be relaxed for those who have difficulties).

<img src="/assets/images/the-rules/fr/deplacement.svg" alt="Movement" style="max-width:348px;width:348px;">

Move the Hot Air Balloon Die from space to space using your **Movement Points** shown on the **Hot Air Balloon Die**. The cost of movement depends on the **type of space you are moving to**:

- **3 Movement Points** for a **Mountain Island**
- **2 Movement Points** for a **Forest Island**
- **1 Movement Point** for a **Plain** or in the **absence** of islands

**Note:** You do not have to use all your Movement Points.

<img src="/assets/images/the-rules/fr/arrimage.svg" alt="Mooring" style="max-width:274px;width:274px;">

If the Hot Air Balloon Die is on a *Cloud* or *unoccupied Island* (neither by a **Cloud** nor by an **Airship**) after moving, turn the **Hot Air Balloon Die** (the **bottom face becomes the top**).

**Note:** The **Island** or **Cloud** is now **moored to your hot air balloon**.

<img src="/assets/images/the-rules/fr/remorquage.svg" alt="Towing" style="max-width:342px;width:342px;">

If you managed to moor to an **Island** or a **Cloud**, move the **Hot Air Balloon Die** again using the **Movement Points** indicated by the new face of the Die.
During this movement, the **moored Island** or **Cloud** is moved **with the Hot Air Balloon Die**.
The same movement rules apply.

* If an Island is towed, the player must end their movement on **a space not occupied by another island.** If this space is occupied by a **Cloud**, place **the Cloud above the island**.
* If a Cloud is towed, it is **Anchored** at the end of the towing: **it is placed vertically in one of the spaces adjacent to the tile occupied by the Hot Air Balloon Die at the end of the towing.**

<img src="/assets/images/the-rules/fr/atterrissage.svg" alt="Landing" style="max-width:300px;width:300px;">

If after **Towing**, you end the turn on an **unoccupied Island**, replace the **Hot Air Balloon Die** with your **Airship Token** on it. This **Island** cannot be moved until your next turn.

If it is already occupied (by a **Cloud** or another **Airship**), keep your **Airship Token**.

<img src="/assets/images/the-rules/fr/effets-des-nuages.svg" alt="Cloud Effects" style="max-width:514px;width:514px;position:relative;left:50%;margin-left:-257px;">

Each Anchored cloud has an effect on the two adjacent islands:
* **Rain** increases the production of plantations (flowers, mushrooms, and crystals) on the two adjacent islands by 1 but decreases the number of animals (cows, reindeer, and llamas) by 1.
* **Sunny Weather** increases the number of animals (cows, reindeer, and llamas) on the adjacent islands by 1 but decreases their plantation production by 1 (flowers, mushrooms, and crystals).
* **Fog** prohibits the movement of the adjacent islands. A **Fog Token** is placed immediately when fog is anchored to represent it. If the fog is adjacent to an empty space, an island can still be placed there, but it cannot be moved afterward.

*Example of point counting with Clouds.*

<img src="/assets/images/the-rules/fr/fin-de-partie.svg" alt="End of Game" style="max-width:428px;width:428px;position:relative;left:50%;margin-left:-214px;">

**The end of the game is triggered once 9 Clouds have been Anchored.** Finish the current turn, and the game ends **once the last player has finished their turn.**

Summing the points from their two objectives, the person with the highest score at the end of the game wins.
**If multiple players are tied, they share the victory.**

<img src="/assets/images/the-rules/fr/mode-duel.svg" alt="Duel Mode" style="max-width:396px;width:396px;position:relative;left:50%;margin-left:-198px;">

If you are playing with two players, each has two Airship tokens.
During setup, take two Airship tokens per player instead of one.

During the **Takeoff** phase:
* if both of your Airship tokens are on the board, take back only one of these tokens.
* if only one of your Airship tokens is on the board, leave it in place.

During the **Landing** phase, you place only one of your tokens per turn (even if both of your tokens are available).

<img src="/assets/images/the-rules/fr/mise-en-place-avance.svg" alt="Advanced Setup" style="max-width:436px;width:436px;position:relative;left:50%;margin-left:-218px;">

For more balanced games, during the **setup**, ensure to form groups of islands of the same type containing:
- **either 3 or 4 animals** (cows, reindeer, and llamas).
- **less than 4 resources** (flowers, mushrooms, and crystals).

<img src="/assets/images/the-rules/fr/mode-avance.svg" alt="Advanced Mode" style="max-width:440px;width:440px;position:relative;left:50%;margin-left:-220px;">

The **advanced game mode** is intended for players who have already played one or more games and are already proficient in hot air balloon navigation!
In this game mode, you replace the **Normal Balloon Die** with the **Advanced Balloon Die**.

This game mode impacts:
* **Turn Flow**: **Takeoff** and **Landing** remain **unchanged**, but the 3 phases **Movement, Docking, and Towing** are replaced by the 2 phases **Island Navigation and Cloud Navigation** (explained below).
* **End of Game**: triggered as soon as **13 Clouds** have been Anchored.

<img src="/assets/images/the-rules/fr/decollage.svg" alt="Takeoff" style="max-width:344px;width:344px;">

The takeoff phase remains unchanged compared to normal mode.

<img src="/assets/images/the-rules/fr/navigation.svg" alt="Navigation" style="max-width:224px;width:224px;">

<img src="/assets/images/the-rules/fr/navigation-iles.svg" alt="Island Navigation" style="max-width:282px;width:282px;">

If the **Balloon Die** shows **balloons**, you are in the **Island Navigation** phase.
In this case, you can use the **Movement Points** displayed by the **Balloon Die** to move your **Hot Air Balloon**, either alone or towing the **Unoccupied Island** it is on.

You can tow multiple islands in the same turn.
**Note: You cannot leave two Islands on the same square.**

If this is your first **Navigation** phase, then flip the die and perform the **Cloud Navigation** phase once before ending your turn.

<img src="/assets/images/the-rules/fr/navigation-nuages.svg" alt="Cloud Navigation" style="max-width:334px;width:334px;">

If the **Balloon Die** shows one or more **clouds**, you are in the **Cloud Navigation** phase.
In this case, you can use the **Movement Points** displayed by the **Balloon Die** to move your **Hot Air Balloon**, either alone or towing an **Unanchored Cloud** it is on.

You can tow multiple clouds in the same turn.
**Note: You cannot leave two unanchored clouds on the same square.**

At the end of this phase, anchor the cloud that is on the same square as your die if there is one. At most, only one cloud is anchored per turn.
If this is your first **Navigation** phase, then flip the die and perform the **Island Navigation** phase once before ending your turn.

<img src="/assets/images/the-rules/fr/atterrissage2.svg" alt="Landing" style="max-width:300px;width:300px;">

The landing phase remains unchanged compared to normal mode.

<img src="/assets/images/the-rules/fr/mini-extension-intemperies.svg" alt="Mini Extension: Intempéries" style="max-width:438px;width:438px;position:relative;left:50%;margin-left:-219px;">

The **Intempéries** mini extension is optional and can be used to spice up games in both **Normal** or **Advanced** mode.

This mini extension includes the **Sun Die** and the **Monsoon Die** which are randomly rolled into the box during setup (before distributing missions).

These two dice affect all tiles within a distance **less than or equal to the value** shown on the die (1, 2, or 3). The distance rules are the same as the movement rules. The tile on which the die is located is always considered at a **distance of 0** and will therefore always be affected regardless of the die value.

When being towed, an Island can be placed on a tile occupied by a **Weather Die**. In this case, the **Weather Die** is placed on top of the Island. 
Similar to a Cloud or an Airship, an Island occupied by a **Weather Die** cannot be towed.

At the end of the game:
* All tiles affected by the **Monsoon Die** have their plantations doubled (flowers, mushrooms, and crystals). The count of animals remains unchanged.
* All tiles affected by the **Sun Die** have their animals doubled (cows, reindeers, and llamas). The count of plantations remains unchanged.

The position and value of these two **Weather Dice** can be modified by targeting them with the **Balloon Die** during the **Takeoff** phase.
Similar to the **Balloon Die**, if at the end of the takeoff phase, a die ends up between multiple tiles, it is the active player who decides its placement.
For the modification of a **Weather Die** to be valid, the **Balloon Die** must land on the board. 
If it goes off the board, immediately place any Weather Dice impacted back to their original position and value.

The **Weather Dice** cannot be modified in value or position when the end of the game is triggered (once the count of anchored clouds is done). 
If this happens anyway, replace the Weather Die at its original position and value.
