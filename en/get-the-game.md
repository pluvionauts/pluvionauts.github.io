**The official version of the game** can currently be purchased on the author's online store: <a href="https://lesjeuxderemi.fr" target="_blank">Les Jeux de RÃ©mi</a>.

**Les Pluvionautes** is a [free and open project](/fr/a-propos/), open to production, distribution, publishing, and sales by third parties. You can even [make the game yourself](#fabriquer-le-jeu) if you have a laser cutting machine.

**WARNING regarding sales:** Board games (like toys) are subject to regulations depending on the countries where they are sold. If you decide to sell your own production of Les Pluvionautes, make sure to research the regulations in effect beforehand.

If you decide to produce and distribute the game yourself and want to see your service appear on this site, or if you know another distribution channel for the game, feel free to open an ["issue" on GitHub](https://github.com/pluvionauts/pluvionauts.github.io/issues) or contact me via email ([rmonthil.games@gmail.com](mailto:rmonthil.games@gmail.com)) or on social media ([@rmonthill](https://www.instagram.com/rmonthill/)).

To make the game, you will need access to a laser cutting/engraving machine.
The cutting files and all game designs can be found on the [official project repository](https://github.com/pluvionauts/board_game_the_pluvionauts).
Feel free to modify the designs to make your project unique!

If you do not have a cutting machine, you can use an **on-demand cutting service**, such as [Damengo](https://damengo.com/), a laser cutting, engraving, and marking service based in Toulouse.

Once the cutting is done, follow the [instructions to assemble the game](#monter-le-jeu).

If you have just completed the cutting and assembly of the box, feel free to use any six-sided die at first to play the game: just consider the **1** and **6** as *Airship faces*.

If you want to design your own dice, you can, for example, order blank dice (e.g., from [Tout Pour le Jeu](https://toutpourlejeu.com/)) and draw the icons yourself.

Otherwise, some services offer customizable dice and allow engraving or printing your designs on the dice, such as [Alea-Jacta-Est](https://des-personnalisables.com/), a French manufacturer of customized dice based in Marseille.

If you are making the game yourself or using a **cutting service**, you will need to assemble the game yourself.
*You will need* **liquid glue** available in supermarkets (or **wood glue** if you have it).

**Start by assembling the Forest and Mountain tiles**: Apply the glue to a tile marked with a glue pot and attach the corresponding tile.

![Assembling the tiles.](/assets/images/get-the-game/glue-the-tiles.svg)

**Then assemble the box.** Start by identifying **the two "borders" that ensure closure** (topped with a central protrusion).
Insert them face to face on the base of the box.

Next, insert each other border and seal everything by inserting the last pieces to form the box/board.
**Warning:** these pieces are particularly fragile during assembly.

You can now place the lid to close the box.

**Note:** The lid may stick a bit until the wood "settles". The more you open and close the box, the easier it will become.
