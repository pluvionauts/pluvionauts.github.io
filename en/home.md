A big storm has hit the aerial world! As a **"Pluvionaut"**, a proud **air balloon pilot**, it's up to you to find a new land for the inhabitants of your destroyed village! 
Luckily, an uninhabited archipelago is in sight! But beware, other pilots have also spotted it...

Be **the first to shape the sky to your advantage** and settle your villagers in this new land before your competitors do ... or you'll have to find another archipelago to settle on!
