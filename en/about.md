Hi, I'm **RÃ©mi Monthiller**. I'm a small creator born in 1996 who likes to dabble in everything, from **game design** to **drawing** and **scientific research**.
I am **passionate about free software** and a dedicated gamer, whether it's sports, board games, or video games.

Despite my academic studies leading me towards science, I can't remember a time when I didn't try to **create my own games** (from board games to [video games](https://rmonthil.itch.io/)).

The Covid-19 crisis pushed me to work more actively on a long-standing board game idea, which I was able to bring to life during my final year of [PhD in fluid physics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDYkYfR8kcw&t).
I then decided to invest my time in developing my board game idea, which resulted in this project: **Les Pluvionautes**.

I am always open to discussion and new projects, so feel free to contact me via email ([rmonthil.games@gmail.com](mailto:rmonthil.games@gmail.com)) or on social media ([@rmonthill](https://www.instagram.com/rmonthill/)).

<img src="/assets/images/about/fr/la-philosophie.svg" alt="The Philosophy" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 450px; width: 100%;">

The philosophy of this project is strongly inspired by that of [Pepper&Carrot](https://www.peppercarrot.com/en/), a free webcomic project created by [David Revoy](https://www.davidrevoy.com/) who is a significant source of inspiration. Go check out his work, it's great!

**Les Pluvionautes** is a project that aims to be as independent as possible to allow its evolution in the most open and accessible way. Moreover, if you want to support me in the creation of more projects adhering to this philosophy, feel free to support me on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/rmonthil).

Even though this open approach is still rarely practiced in the board game publishing industry (although we can note the existence of [Cards Against Humanity](https://www.cardsagainsthumanity.com/) under a Creative Commons BY-NC-SA license), it stems from a desire to design and produce board games differently.

Despite having different approaches, this project was also inspired by other publishing/creation studios that seek to do things differently, such as [Subverti](https://subverti.com/fr/) or [Ludenbois](https://www.ludenbois.fr/) and many others.

All the content I produce for **Les Pluvionautes**, including drawings and graphics, game rules, laser cutting/engraving plans, and more, is available freely and at no cost, and is accessible to everyone.

**Everyone has the right** to share, use, develop **and even commercialize** projects based on **Les Pluvionautes**.
And to promote this philosophy, all the resources of this project are made using free and open-source software: [SolveSpace](https://solvespace.com/index.pl) and [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).

**Commercial use**, translations, fan art, prints, videos, video games, sharing, and reposts are **encouraged**.
It is only requested to **credit the work** you wish to use to the **authors involved** in its creation (designers, illustrators, translators...), **include a link to the license**, and indicate any **changes made**.

You must indicate this information by all reasonable means, without suggesting that the authors endorse you or your use of their work.
For more information, please refer to the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en).

In summary, you are **free to modify the game rules**, **create and sell expansions** or **new versions** of the game, or simply **share and enjoy** the game!
