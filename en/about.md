## The author

Hi, my name is **RÃ©mi Monthiller** and I'm a French artist/game dev/scientist born in 1996. 
I'm a free(libre) software enthusiast and an every day gamer through sports, board games, role playing, video games and life in general.

Throughout my studies, I can't remember a time without trying to create my own games, from board games to [video games](https://rmonthil.itch.io/), despite my academic pursuits leading me towards science.
The Covid-19 pandemic got me to start working more actively on a long-term board game idea, which I completed during the final year of my [Ph.D. in physics of fluids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDYkYfR8kcw&t).
I then decided to invest my time in bringing my board game idea to fruition, resulting in this project: **The Pluvionauts**.

If you have any inquiries, please feel free to email me at [rmonthil.games@gmail.com](mailto:rmonthil.games@gmail.com).

## The philosophy

The philosophy of this project is strongly influenced by that of [Pepper&Carrot](https://www.peppercarrot.com/en/), a cartoon project by [David Revoy](https://www.davidrevoy.com/) which serves as a great inspiration.

### Supported by patrons

**The Pluvionauts** project is intended to be solely funded by its patrons worldwide, with this system designed to ensure the project evolves freely and independently of marketing strategies.
The ability to support the project is still **work in progress** but I'll get there.

### Free(libre)

All content I produce for **The Pluvionauts**, including art, game rules, blueprints, tutorials and more, will be provided on this website, free(libre) and available to everyone.
You will never be asked to pay or subscribe to anything to access to new content from the **The Pluvionauts** project.

### Open-source and permissive

People will have the right to share, use, build upon and even make money from this work.
And to promote this philosophy, all resources for this project will be produced using Free(Libre) Open-Sources Software, including [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), [Krita](https://krita.org), [SolveSpace](https://solvespace.com/index.pl), among others.

All sources will be available on this website.
Commercial usage, translations, fan-art, prints, movies, video-games, sharing, and reposts are **encouraged** with appropriate credit to the authors involved in the resource you want to use, and indicating any changes that were made.
You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the authors endorse you or your use. 
For more information, please refer to the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en).

In summary, you are free to modify the game rules, create and sell extensions or new versions of the game, or simply share and **enjoy the board game**!
