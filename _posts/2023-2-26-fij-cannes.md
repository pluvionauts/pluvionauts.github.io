I had the pleasure of attending the [Festival International des Jeux](https://www.festivaldesjeux-cannes.com/en/) in Cannes (France) for the second time this weekend! 
I had the opportunity to show and test the latest laser-cut version of the board game in the Off section of the festival.

Playing was so much fun! The core mechanics were greatly enjoyed by most players. 
Throwing the dice on the board and moving mountains around with the airship were especially appreciated.
People where very nice and took the time to discuss and share their thoughts about the game.

The feedback was overwhelmingly positive, which further increases my motivation for the project! 
However, a few players expressed a bit frustration with the play order, as the last player had a significant impact on the game just before the point count.

Nevertheless, after discussing with the players, we found a small tweak that could counter this small issue, that will be tested in the upcoming version of the game!

Overall, this amazing event felt like a great success for **The Pluvionauts** project!
We're one step closer to a final version of the game before trying to optimize the production.
