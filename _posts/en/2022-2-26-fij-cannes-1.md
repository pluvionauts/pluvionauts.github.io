Today, I participated for the first time in the **Off** section of the [Festival International des Jeux](https://www.festivaldesjeux-cannes.com/en/) in Cannes (France).

I've met very nice people that gave me amazing feedback! 
This motivates to push the idea forward as much as I can and see where it goes.
There is still some rule tweaking to do but we are going in the right direction!
