## The author

Hi, my name is RÃ©mi Monthiller and I'm a French artist/game dev/scientist born in 1996. 
I'm a free(libre) software enthusiast and an every day gamer through sports, board games, role playing, video games and life in general.
I like experimenting, especially through non-competitive life challenges, such as living without a fridge or by washing my clothes by hand (for a limited amount of time).

Throughout my studies, I can't remember a time without trying to create my own games, either sports, board games or even [video games](https://rmonthil.itch.io/) even though my studies carried me in the direction of science.
The additional free-time found during the Covid-19 crisis got me to work more actively on a long-term board game idea that I finalised during the last year of my studies.
Therefore, after finishing my [Ph.D. in physics of fluids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDYkYfR8kcw&t), I decided to spend my time carrying this board game idea as far as possible and ended in **The Pluvionauts**!

## The philosophy

The philosophy of this project is strongly similar to that of the [Pepper&Carrot](https://www.peppercarrot.com/en/) project by [David Revoy](https://www.davidrevoy.com/) who is a real inspiration.

### Supported by patrons

**The Pluvionauts** project should only be funded by its patrons, from all around the world that should ensure the Independence of the project.
Note that in practice, the ability to support is still work in progress but I'll get there at some point.

### Free(libre)

All the content produced for **The Pluvionauts** (art, game rules, all various blue prints or tutorials) will be provided on this website, free(libre) and available to everyone. 
**The Pluvionauts** will never ask you to pay anything to get access to new content.

### Open-source and permissive

People will have the right to share, use, build and even make money upon the work I've created.
To promote this philosophy, all resources of this project will be produced using Free(Libre) Open-Sources Software (among which [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), [Krita](https://krita.org), [SolveSpace](https://solvespace.com/index.pl)...)

All sources will be available on this website. 
Commercial usage, translations, fan-art, prints, movies, video-games, sharing, and reposts are encouraged with appreciate credit to the authors (involved in the resource you want to use) and by indicating if changes were made. 
You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the authors endorse you or your use. 
More information can be read about it here: [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en).

Overall, feel free to change the rules, build and sell extensions or new version of the game if you'd like or just share and enjoy the board game!
